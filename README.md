# 💬 Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

An NLP-powered project that classifies user reviews as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** using modern text processing and machine learning.

---

## 🚀 Overview
The goal of this project is to automatically analyze customer feedback and understand public sentiment toward products or services.  
This helps companies **monitor brand perception** and **improve customer satisfaction** efficiently.

## 📊 Dataset
**Source:** IMDb / Twitter Sentiment Dataset  
**Description:**
- 50,000+ text reviews labeled as positive or negative  
- Features: user review text  
- Target: sentiment label (Positive / Negative)

Key preprocessing:
- Text cleaning (lowercasing, removing punctuation & stopwords)
- Tokenization & Lemmatization
- TF-IDF Vectorization for numerical representation

---

## 🧩 Model & Methodology
- Models tested: **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Best model: **SVM (Linear Kernel)** with **92% accuracy**
- Implemented cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

---

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Libraries:** NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Streamlit
